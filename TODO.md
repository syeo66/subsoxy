# TODO

## Current Priorities

### âœ… **Song Removal During Sync** - COMPLETED
- **Status**: âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Differential sync strategy successfully deployed
- **Implementation**: Complete differential sync with song removal and data preservation
- **Key Features**:
  - **Intelligent Library Management**: Automatically removes songs that no longer exist upstream
  - **Data Preservation**: Maintains user play counts, skip counts, and listening history for existing songs
  - **Historical Integrity**: Preserves play events and transition data as historical records
  - **Efficient Algorithm**: Map-based comparison for optimal performance
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite including edge cases and data preservation
  - **Production Verified**: Tested with real Subsonic server using curl commands
- **Files Updated**: `server/server.go:544-589`, `database/database.go:416-499`
- **Database Methods Added**: `GetExistingSongIDs()`, `DeleteSongs()`
- **Tests Added**: `TestGetExistingSongIDs`, `TestDeleteSongs`, `TestDifferentialSyncWorkflow`
- **Impact**: âœ… Prevents database bloat, eliminates "zombie songs", maintains data integrity

### 1. **Test Coverage Gaps** ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
- **Issue**: Several modules could benefit from additional test coverage
- **Risk**: Untested edge cases and error conditions  
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive tests, especially for error scenarios and edge cases
- **Files**: All `*_test.go` files
- **Areas to focus on**:
  - Error handling edge cases
  - Concurrent access scenarios
  - Input validation boundary conditions
  - Network timeout and failure scenarios

### 2. **Documentation Restructure** ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
- **Issue**: README.md is comprehensive but could be more user-focused
- **Risk**: Poor user experience, difficult to find essential information quickly
- **Fix**: 
  - Consider moving some technical details to dedicated documentation files
  - Create separate documentation files for architecture, development, troubleshooting
  - Maintain focus on user needs in main README
  - Create `docs/` folder structure for advanced topics
- **Files**: `README.md`, create `docs/` folder structure

## Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

### Performance Optimizations ðŸŸ¢
- **Database Query Optimization**: Review and optimize complex queries
- **Memory Usage Profiling**: Profile memory usage under high load
- **Connection Pool Tuning**: Fine-tune database connection pool parameters
- **Caching Layer**: Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

## Implementation Notes

- **Current State**: All critical issues have been resolved
- **Code Quality**: High - comprehensive error handling, testing, and documentation
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade with security headers middleware
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Fully implemented with complete user isolation
- **Performance**: Optimized with connection pooling and efficient algorithms

## Completed Major Features âœ…

The following major features have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… **Differential Sync**: Complete song removal during sync with data preservation and historical integrity
- âœ… **Test Suite Fixes**: Fixed compilation errors and mock server issues for comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… **Background Sync Authentication Fix**: Fixed token authentication in song sync for modern Subsonic clients
- âœ… **Multi-User Song Sync**: Complete background sync for all users
- âœ… **Security Headers Middleware**: Production-grade security with dev mode
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Go 1.13+ compatible structured error handling
- âœ… **Database Connection Pooling**: Advanced pool management with health monitoring
- âœ… **Rate Limiting**: DoS protection with token bucket algorithm
- âœ… **CORS Support**: Comprehensive cross-origin resource sharing
- âœ… **Input Validation**: Complete sanitization and validation
- âœ… **Credential Security**: AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage
- âœ… **Weighted Shuffle**: Intelligent personalized song recommendations
- âœ… **Multi-Tenancy**: Complete user data isolation

## Legend
- ðŸ”´ Critical - Fix immediately
- ðŸŸ  High - Fix within 1-2 weeks  
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Fix within 1 month
- ðŸŸ¢ Low - Fix as time permits
